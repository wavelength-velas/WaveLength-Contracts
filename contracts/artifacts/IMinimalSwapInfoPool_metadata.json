			"details": "Pool contracts with the MinimalSwapInfo or TwoToken specialization settings should implement this interface. This is called by the Vault when a user calls `IVault.swap` or `IVault.batchSwap` to swap with this Pool. Returns the number of tokens the Pool will grant to the user in a 'given in' swap, or that the user will grant to the pool in a 'given out' swap. This can often be implemented by a `view` function, since many pricing algorithms don't need to track state changes in swaps. However, contracts implementing this in non-view functions should check that the caller is indeed the Vault.",

The Vault will then take tokens from the Pool's balances and send them to `recipient`, as well as collect the reported amount in protocol fees, which the Pool should calculate based on `protocolSwapFeePercentage`. Protocol fees are charged on exit events to guarantee that users exiting the Pool have paid their share. `sender` is the account performing the exit (typically the pool shareholder), and `recipient` is the account to which the Vault will send the proceeds. `currentBalances` contains the total token balances for each token the Pool registered in the Vault, in the same order that `IVault.getPoolTokens` would return. `lastChangeBlock` is the last block in which *any* of the Pool's registered tokens last changed its total balance. `userData` contains any pool-specific instructions needed to perform the calculations, such as the type of exit (e.g., proportional given an amount of pool shares, single-asset, multi-asset, etc.) Contracts implementing this function should check that the caller is indeed the Vault before performing any state-changing operations, such as burning pool shares."

The Vault will then take tokens from `sender` and add them to the Pool's balances, as well as collect the reported amount in protocol fees, which the pool should calculate based on `protocolSwapFeePercentage`. Protocol fees are reported and charged on join events so that the Pool is free of debt whenever new users join. `sender` is the account performing the join (from which tokens will be withdrawn), and `recipient` is the account designated to receive any benefits (typically pool shares). `currentBalances` contains the total balances for each token the Pool registered in the Vault, in the same order that `IVault.getPoolTokens` would return. `lastChangeBlock` is the last block in which *any* of the Pool's registered tokens last changed its total balance. `userData` contains any pool-specific instructions needed to perform the calculations, such as the type of join (e.g., proportional given an amount of pool shares, single-asset, multi-asset, etc.) Contracts implementing this function should check that the caller is indeed the Vault before performing any state-changing operations, such as minting pool shares."
