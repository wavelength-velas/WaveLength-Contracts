     *
     * If the caller is not `sender`, it must be an authorized relayer for them.
     *
     * The `tokens` and `minAmountsOut` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the minimum
     * token amount to receive for each token contract. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault:
     * it just enforces these minimums.
     *
     * If exiting a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to receive ETH directly: the Vault will do the unwrapping. To
     * enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead

     * `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when
     * interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If receiving ETH however, the array must
     * be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the
     * final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be exited.
     *
     * If `toInternalBalance` is true, the tokens will be deposited to `recipient`'s Internal Balance. Otherwise,
     * an ERC20 transfer will be performed. Note that ETH cannot be deposited to Internal Balance: attempting to
     * do so will trigger a revert.
     *
     * `minAmountsOut` is the minimum amount of tokens the user expects to get out of the Pool, for each token in the
     * `tokens` array. This array must match the Pool's registered tokens.
     *
     * This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onExitPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement
     * their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number

    // Swaps
    //
    // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.
